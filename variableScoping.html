    <h2>JavaScript Scope</h2>
    <p>Variable Scope. Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of
        variables to JavaScript. The two types of scope are local and global: Global variables are those declared
        outside of a block. Local variables are those declared inside of a block.</p>
