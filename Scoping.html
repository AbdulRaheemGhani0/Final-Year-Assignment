    <p><b>Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.</b><br>
     JavaScript variables have 3 types of scope:  
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Block scope</li>
        <li>Function scope</li>
        <li>Global scope</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><b>Block Scope</b></h3>
    <p>
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript variables had only Global Scope and Function Scope.

ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
    </p>
    <h3><b>Local Scope</b></h3>
    <p>
        Variables declared within a JavaScript function, are LOCAL to the function:<br>
        Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.<br>
        Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Function Scope</b></h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.

        <br>Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
        
        <br> Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.
        
        <br>They all have Function Scope:
